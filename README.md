# ACME Solar Prediction (AMS 2014 Kaggle Competition)

Machine Learning I group project (MSc Business Analytics & Data Science).

## Goal
Forecast solar energy output using historical measurements and station metadata.

## What we did
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Generated a Kaggle-ready predictions file

## Contents
- **ACME_Prediction_Group_2.ipynb**: end-to-end notebook (EDA + modeling)
- **EDA_Visuals_Group2.pptx**: EDA slides
- **Group 2 summary.pdf**: short project summary
- **predictions_acme.csv**: final predictions output (submission format)

## Data
The competition data is not included in this repository.

## How to run
1. Download the competition data from Kaggle
2. Place the files in a local `data/` folder (or update the paths inside the notebook)
3. Run `ACME_Prediction_Group_2.ipynb`

## Notes
Competition data is excluded via `.gitignore`.
